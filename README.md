## Description
------
My motivation for creating this app was to gain experience using Node.JS, work with a new CSS framework, use two third-party APIs, and better understand reading documentation.

This is a random recipe generator I created, to test my knowledge of third-party API calls. This project uses the Spoonacular API for its food recipe generation, and The Cocktail DB for it's cocktail recipes. The purpose of the site is to allow users the ability to type in a recipe/ingredient, and then receive a random recipe based on that value for either a food dish, or a cocktail. Once a recipe is populated, users have the ability to go through the list of ingredients, and add them to a grocery list. Once the items are added, the user can save the list for later, print the list, or remove items from the list. Items are added and removed from the list by double-clicking on the item.

During this project, I also wanted to get some experience with another CSS framework (other than Bootstrap). To accomplish this, I ended up using Materialize (my first time using), and found it quite easy to work with. By using two third-part APIs I had never worked with before, and a CSS framework I had never worked with before, I was able to get a lot of experience with reading documentation. This was also one of the main reasons for undertaking this project.

## Installation
------
A working demo of this application can be seen [Here](https://tdgreer1203.github.io/Random-Recipes/).



## Useage
------
To use this app, simply navigate to the page above, and type in a random recipe. After typing in your random recipe, you can chose to receive either a food dish, or a cocktail based on the ingredient you've entered. Once a recipe is returned, you will be able to view the details of the recipe, see an image of the recipe (if one is returned), and view the contents of the recipe. Each content is able to be added to a grocery list, by double-clicking on that particular item. From the grocery list, you can choose to save the list, print the list, or delete the items from the list. Items in the list can also can also be double-clicked to remove a single item from the list.
